# SYSTEM DESIGN

- System Architecture Overview
    - Tech Stack:
        - Programming Language: Node.js with TypeScript
        - Backend Framework: Express.js or NestJS
        - Cloud Provider: Azure
        - Database: MongoDB (for flexible schema) with Azure Cosmos DB
        - Authentication: JWT with Azure Active Directory B2C
    Monitoring: New Relic
    News API Integration: Multiple news sources APIs

    Key Components:

    - Authentication and User Management

    - Implement secure user registration and login
    - Use Azure Active Directory B2C for robust authentication
    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
    - Encrypt sensitive user information at rest and in transit
    - Implement multi-factor authentication

    - Data Storage Architecture

    - User Collection: Store user profiles, encrypted personal information
    - Immigration Cases Collection: Store case details with access controls
    - Lawyers Collection: Store lawyer profiles and availability
    - News Collection: Cache and store aggregated news items

    - News Aggregation System

    - Implement background workers to fetch news from multiple APIs
    - Use cron jobs to periodically update news feed
    - Implement caching mechanism to reduce API call costs
    - Potential news sources:

    Immigration-focused news APIs
    Government immigration websites
    Specialized immigration news platforms

    - Lawyer Appointment Scheduling

    - Create a booking system with lawyer availability slots
    - Implement reservation and cancellation mechanisms
    - Send confirmation emails/notifications

    Security Considerations

    - Use Azure Key Vault for secret management
    - Implement data encryption for sensitive fields
    - Follow GDPR and CCPA compliance guidelines
    - Use HTTPS for all communications
    - Implement rate limiting and input validation

    - API Endpoints Design
    - typescriptCopy// User Authentication Endpoints
    - POST /auth/register
    - POST /auth/login
    - POST /auth/reset-password

    // News Endpoints
    - GET /news/latest
    - GET /news/categories
    - GET /news/search

    // Immigration Case Endpoints
    POST /cases/create
    - GET /cases/:caseId
    - PUT /cases/:caseId
    - DELETE /cases/:caseId

    // Lawyer Endpoints
    - GET /lawyers
    - GET /lawyers/:lawyerId
    - POST /appointments/book
    - GET /appointments/available-slots

    - Monitoring and Logging

    Integrate New Relic for:

    - Performance monitoring
    - Error tracking
    - System health checks
    - Resource utilization tracking

    Scalability Considerations

    Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration
    - Implement horizontal scaling
    - Use message queues for asynchronous processing
    - Implement caching with Redis

    Proposed Database Schema (MongoDB)

    User Schema - src/schemas/userSchemas.ts

    - Immigration Case Schema - src/schemas/caseSchemas.ts

    - Lawyer Schema - src/schemas/lawyerSchemas.ts

    Potential Challenges and Mitigation

    API Rate Limits

    Implement robust caching
    Use multiple news API sources
    Handle API failures gracefully

    Data Privacy

    - Use encryption for sensitive data
    - Implement strict access controls
    - Regular security audits

    Recommended Next Steps

    - Create detailed API documentation
    - Set up development environment
    - Implement basic authentication flow
    - Create database migration scripts
    - Set up CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps
